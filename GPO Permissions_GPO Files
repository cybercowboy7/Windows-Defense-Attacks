Description:

  - GPO (Group Policy Object) is a virtual collection of policy settings that has
    a unique name.

  - Most widely used configuration managemenet tool in AD

  - Each GPO contains a colletion of zero or more policy settings. They are linked to 
    an Organizational Unit in the AD structure for their settings to be applied to objects
    that reside in the OU or any child OU of the one to which the GPO is linked.

  - When we create a new GPO, only Domain admins (and similar privileged roles) can modify it. However, within environments, we will encounter different delegations that allow less 
    privileged accounts to perform edits on the GPOs; this is where the problem lies

  - Many organizations have GPOs that can modify 'Authenticated Users' or 'Domain Users', which entails that any compromised user will allow the attacker to alter these GPOs. 
    Modifications can include additions of start-up scripts or a scheduled task to execute a file, for example. This access will allow an adversary to 
    compromise all computer objects in the OUs that the vulnerable GPOs are linked to.

  - Administrators perform software installation via GPOs or configure start-up scripts located on network shares. If the network share is misconfigured, an adversary may be able to 
    replace the file to be executed by the system with a malicious one.


Prevention:

  - Lock down the GPO permissions to be modified by a particular group of users only or by a specific account, as this will significantly limit the ability of who can edit the GPO or
    change its permissions (as opposed to everybody in Domain admins, which in some organizations can easily be more than 50.

  - Never deploy files stored in network locations so that many users can modify the share permissions.

  - Review permissions of GPOs actively and regularly, with the option of automating a task that runs hourly and alerts if any deviations from the unexpected permissions are detected.


Detection:

  - If Directory Service Changes auditing is enabled, then the event ID 5136 will be generated.


Honeypot:

  - Have a misconfigured GPO in the environmeny for threat agenets to abuse and have deployed files that can be continuosly monitored for any change to the file (check the hash value of file)

  - Implement only if orgnanzation is mature and proactive in repsonding to high/critical vulnerabilities. 

  - Ensure GPO is linked to non-critical servers only

  - Continuous automation is in place for monitoring modifications of GPO. - - If the GPO file is modified, we will disable the user performing the modification immediately.

  - The GPO should be automatically unlinked from all locations if a modification is detected.
