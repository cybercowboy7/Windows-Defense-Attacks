Description:

  - Similar to kerberoasting where we can obtain crackable hashes for user accounts that have the property 'Do not require Kerberos preauthentication'.

  - Success of attack depends on the strength of the user account password that we will crack.


Attack:

  - Utilize Rubeus 
    .\Rubeus.exe asreproast /outfile:asrep.txt

  - Obtains the hashes and puts them in asrep.txt

  - Extract that file to the Kali VM

  - Append 23$ to after $krb5asrep in order to make it known to hashcat that this hash is a kerberos 5 AS-REP          etype 23

  - sudo hashcat -m 18200 -a 0 asrep.txt passwords.txt --outfile asrepcrack.txt --force


Prevention:

  - Only enable 'Do not require Kerberos preauthentication' if you need it

  - Review accounts quarterly to ensure that this porperty is being used properly.

  - Assign a separate password policy for users requiring this configuration

  - Ensure passwords have a good password strength policy to adhere to.


Detection:

  - Generates a 4768 Event ID signaling a Kerberos Authentication Ticket was generated

  - Caveat is that AD generates this 4768 with all users that authenticate using kerberos

  - Try to possibly find the location of authentication and correlate it to known good logins


Honeypot:

  - Honeypot user is a good detection option to configure in AD environments
    - Must be a user with no real use/need in the environment, such that no login attempts are performed regularly
