Description:

  - In AD, ACLs are tables or simple lists that define the trustees who have access
  to a specific object and their access type.

  - Each ACL has a set of access control entries, and each ACE defines the trustees
  and the type of access the trustee has.

  - Therefore, an object can be accessed by multiple trustees since there can be various
  ACEs.

  - ACLs are also used for auditing purposes, such as recording the number of access 
  attempts to a securable object and the type of access.

  - A securable object is any named object in AD that contains a security descriptor, which
  has the security information about the object, which includes ACLs

  - AD gives Domain admins the right to modify the password of every object. However,
  rights can also be delegated to certain users or groups that can perform a specific action
  on other objects; this can be password resets, modifications of group memberships, or deletion
  of objects.

  - Often encounter:
    - All domain users added as Administrators to all Servers
    - Everyone can modify all objects (having full rights to them)
    - All Domain users have access to the computer's extended properties containing the LAPS passwords.


Attack:

  - To ID abusable ACLs we will use Bloodhound to graph the relationships between the objects and Sharphound
  to scan the environment and pass All to the -c parameter (short version of CollectionMethod)

    .\Sharphound.exe -c All

  - The ZIP file generated by Sharphound can then be visualized in Bloodhound

  - Can use ADACLScanner to create reports of discretionary ACLs and system ACLs

Prevention:

  - Begin continuous assessment to detect if this is a problem in the AD environment.

  - Educate employees with high privileges to avoid doing this

  - Automate as much as possible from the access management process, and only assign 
  privileged access to adin accuonts; this ensures that administrators don't manually
  edit accounts which reduces the risk of introducing delegated rights to unprivilged 
  users.


Detection:

  - Event IDs 4724, 4742, and 4738
