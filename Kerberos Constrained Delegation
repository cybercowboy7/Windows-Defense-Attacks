Description:

  - Kerberos Delegation enables an application to access resources on a different server; for example, instead of giving the service account running the web server access
    to the database directly, we can allow the account the be delegated to the SQL server service.

  - Once a user logs into the website, the web server service account will request to the SQL server service on behalf of the user, allowing the user to get access
    to the content in the database that they've been provisioned to without having to assign any access to the web server service account itself.
